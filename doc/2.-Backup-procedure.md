A process for Cassandra backup-restore can be setup using this utility. The process will call the jar created from this project’s code. The command can be called by a scheduled service, one such example could be scheduling a Cron job to execute the command at regular intervals. Below are steps required to executed by the backup process:

1. Record a copy of the keyspace schema for all keyspaces which are included in backup. The keyspaces created by 
   Cassandra internally should not be included. Only backup user generated keyspaces. Saving the schema is 
   required when restoring the backups SSTables (data file). The schema is therefore part of the data to backup.

```[Perform this step on any one node, and for each keyspace kespace_name you want to backup]```

```cqlsh -e "DESC KEYSPACE keyspace_name" > schema-keyspace_name.txt```


2. Capture snapshots for table, keyspaces which should be included in backup at scheduled interval. 

```[Perform this step on each node, and for each keyspace/table you want to backup, perform without keyspace/table option for complete backup]```

```	
java -jar jar_file_name.jar --id <node> --cluster <cluster> --blob-storage [FILE|AWS|GCP|AZURE] --jmx jmx_url --data-directory /path/to/cassandra/data/dir --config-directory /path/to/cassandra/configuration/dir keyspace_name --cf table_name keyspace_name
```
```
# Example for uploading file to S3
java -jar backup-1.0-final.jar --id 10.0.0.100 --cluster prod_cluster --blob-storage AWS_S3  --bucket backup --jmx service:jmx:rmi://127.0.0.1/jndi/rmi://127.0.0.1:7199/jmxrmi --data-directory /var/lib/cassandra/ keyspace1 --cf table1
```
```
# Example for pushing to local file system backup
java -jar backup-1.0-final.jar --id 10.0.0.100 --cluster prod_cluster --blob-storage FILE --filebackup-location /backup  --jmx service:jmx:rmi://127.0.0.1/jndi/rmi://127.0.0.1:7199/jmxrmi --data-directory /var/lib/cassandra/ keyspace1 --cf table1
```

* Options mentioned in command are indicative and should be changed as per specific use case.

* Eliminate option **--cf table_name** leaving only **keyspace_name** to capture complete
keyspace

* Eliminate option **--cf table_name** and **keyspace_name** to capture all keyspaces and
all column families (including internal tables).
