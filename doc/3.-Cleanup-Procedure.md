The backup solution creates a new snapshot of data and copies the same to a remote location. The file copying by backup utility is duplicate proof but the remote location will still have lot of SSTables if not cleared periodically. 

There should be a process which clears SSTables which are not required according to a retention policy e.g. older than a week.

Below are the steps required to clear the files on a routine basis:

1. List and delete all the files and directories which are older than retention period under ‘data’ directory. 

   **Note:** The SSTables which are older than retention period but are included in recent backups will have 
   timestamp greater than backup timestamp. Hence, the corresponding files and directories will not be deleted in time based deletion.

2. List and delete manifest files in ‘manifests’ directory older than retention period.

3. List and delete token files in ‘tokens’ directory older than retention period.


**Note:** In cloud backup, such as S3, automatic deletion of files that have existed longer then the retention policy can be configured.
